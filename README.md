# MNIST-digit-recognition

- `Stavito` is my attempt at coding (from scratch) a neural network designed for data classification into binary or multiple categories. To assess its performance, it must undergo training using a training dataset, followed by accuracy evaluation using a separate test dataset.

- `Perceptron` project represents my attempt at creating a fundamental neural network from the ground up. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts underlying neural networks, which helped me to code "tavito".

## Project Requirements 

- To run `Stavito`, you must have those library installed : 
	- `numpy` => for matrix calculations
	- `matplotlib` => to plot sets, log loss graphics and accuracy graphics
	- `tqdm` => to show live progression when executing the code
	- `time` => to display execution time 
	- `idx2numpy` => to convert photos from MNIST set to usable data for "Stavito"

- To run `Perceptron`, you must have those library installed : 
	- `numpy`
	- `matplotlib`
	- `tqdm`
	- `time`
	- `h5py` => to convert photos from set to usable datas for "Perceptron"
